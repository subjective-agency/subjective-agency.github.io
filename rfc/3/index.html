    <p>Welcome! Thank you for your curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="origins"><strong>Origins</strong></h2>
<p>Wapaganda the Project was conceived in the wake of Russo-Ukrainian war around the end of February 2022. It took some time for it to acquire shape (until the end of summer 2022, give or take), and it wasn't until January 2023 that it was deemed ready enough for public scrutiny.</p>
<p>There is a good reason for such a lengthy timeframe: our team is tiny (2 people currently, just 1 in the beginning), and our resources were and still are quite limited. </p>
<p>//﻿By the way, if you want to support us (and we would appreciate it very much!), there are several ways how you can do that. Check out this page for more info.//</p>
<h2 id="essence"><strong>Essence</strong></h2>
<p>So, what is Wapaganda, exactly?</p>
<p>On the surface you will find here a catalog of personalities, each of whom is guilty of actively supporting Vladimir Putin's criminal regime by  propagating false narratives and tropes, and with goals of easing the negative effects of the war on the Russian population and pumping up support for the regime. Why we believe that propaganda is such an important machinery for this process is explained over here.</p>
<p>Underneath the flimsy list of obscure individuals, there is an immense amount of data and hundreds of tiny relationships connecting all the separate pieces into a vast and fascinating system - complex, but not unfathomable.</p>
<p>We are working to accumulate all possible data on these people, including their written works (actual books and articles, as well as blog posts, and social media footprint), their appearance in the media (including transcripts of what was said - currently, only a share of data is processed, and is available only in Russian - English translation is planned), anything else that's available out there in the open web, and even a little bit of what the dark web has to offer. Simultaneously, we're mapping all the little pieces together, sort of like a multidimensional jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>This accumulation of data is being done with several things in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, the data would serve as evidence for when these people are tried for their activities.</li>
<li>The data would serve as a basis for working out the <strong>influence rating (P-rating)</strong>, which could be used to assign accountability with better precision.</li>
<li>The data should become a valuable source for any researcher out there. We're following the CVARC model, ensuring data's Completeness, Verifiability, Accessibility, Reliability and Consistency. (TODO)</li>
<li>Finally, the data may serve as a starting spark in the process of establishing international monitoring with the purpose of preventing yet another intricate propagandistic machine from developing.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="criteria"><strong>Criteria</strong></h2>
<p>One important question to answer is how exactly people end up in the Wapaganda database. You might wanna check out the Copium Theory of Propaganda to understand the approach, but in plain language, each and every person on this list has willingly, and oftentimes eagerly, participated in the activities aimed at spreading the narratives of the Putin's creed (TODO). There are other projects out there maintaining lists of <strong>all</strong> kinds of Ukraine's enemies (Myrotvorets, OSINTBees, ..) - we, on the other hand, are specifically focused on the propagandists. You will find here soldiers and collaborants, too, but only if, on top of their military or administrative function, they also propagated the Putin's lies via mass media.</p>
<p>Each and every person is handpicked, and there is always a reason for their inclusion. That being said, mistakes are possible, and if you encounter an incorrect piece of information, please do let us know (TODO).</p>
<p>﻿﻿The bulk of our database is day-to-day propaganda functionaries, such as the cast of the Solovyov Live, 60 minutes, Vesti etc. talk shows, as well as the numerous guests featured there. </p>
<p>Only appearances after February 24, 2022 are taken into account, the assumption being that the start of the war was a sobering experience for some, so a person is considered complicit only if they have continued (or started) ﻿showing up. </p>
<p>Other notable subgroups include high-level figures whom many people know, such as Margarita Simonyan and Dmitry Kiselyov; authors of books and articles directed against Ukraine and/or justifying Russian decrepit ways; semi-independent influencers; foreign friends (agents of influence outside of Russia); and others.</p>
<p>Finally, a swarm of pro-Russian influencers, inhabiting YouTube, TikTok, Telegram and other media platforms, constitutes a significant share of monitoring targets.</p>
<h2 id="data"><strong>Data</strong></h2>
<p>What kind of data is being absorbed, what can you find here?</p>
<p>First off, there's data that's already available out there, in other sources. In Wapaganda it's organized a little better, and generally more accessible.</p>
<p>Then, there is data that comes from the ongoing process of observation. Mostly, these are media appearances, quotes, and full transcripts of what was said.</p>
<p>We monitor and scrape media platforms, including YouTube, Smotrim.ru, Vk.com.</p>
<p>There is Telegram channels statistics, as well as a backup of their history (730+ channels, close to 10 million messages in total).</p>
<p>Not all of these riches are currently fully accessible. If you want to speed up the process a bit, you can do it here (TODO).</p>
